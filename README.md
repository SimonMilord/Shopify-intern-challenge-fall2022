# Shopify Intern Challenge Fall 2022 : Bot-pedia


## Challenge Overview

Write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

The app should have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
* A form for entering text prompts
* Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
* Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.

### Technical Requirements
* Results should come from OpenAIâ€™s completions API
* Each result should include at least the original prompt you entered and the response from the API
* Responses should be stored in order of newest to oldest
* The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic

## My Approach

### App Architechture
Talk about how I built the app, components

### Functionalities
* Localstorage to Save responses if the user leaves or reloads the page
* Clear button to clear both storage and the list on the DOM
* Made the app more specific to a single purpose (with the Q&A bots)

## Usability & Accessibility considerations
Talk about user experience, design, semantic HTML, lighthouse score, keyboard support, etc.

## Environment Variables

REACT_APP_API_URL= https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-curie-001/completions
<br>
REACT_APP_API_KEY= "enter your api key here"
<br>

I decided to go with the text-curie-001 engine here since it had a better balance between speed, cost and accuracy.
